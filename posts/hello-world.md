# Hello, World!
Saying hello from my first blog post!

Welcome to my blog. Here, I will be posting about programming and compilers. In this first post, I am going to talk about the
motivation behind blogging.

To begin with, I started this blog to record what I learn and work on. Most posts will be either in notes or rants, depending on my moods. I hope other developers may find them useful if they are looking for solutions to similar problems.

I am also a *very* active player in Gacha games. My favorites are Honkai: Star Rail and Fate/Grand Order. Do message me on Discord if you have inquiries.
