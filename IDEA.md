# Ideas

Implement a PageRank algorithm to recommend posts based on relationships
and similarity as well as reading patterns. Post graphs _could_ be implemented but
we will have to write a "Can we collect your data window?" thingy. I don't want to
host a server even if it's free sooooooo.... we can technically do this and store
it on local storage but I don't want to get sued by a European for storing
"sensitive" data in an unprotected manner. GDPR is overall a complex law so I don't
want to bother myself doing it.
