    # This simply checks out the repository content and setup the
    # Bun runtime. Then, install Nuekit globally via Bun CLI.
    #
    # After that, build the site. The output is defaulted to `./dist`
    # directory. Now, deploy `./dist` contents to the `pages` branch.
    # If the branch doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.
