Welcome to my blog. Here, I will be posting about programming and compilers. In this first post, I am going to talk about the
motivation behind blogging.

To begin with, I started this blog to record what I learn and work on. Most posts will be either in notes or rants, depending on my moods. I hope other developers may find them useful if they are looking for solutions to similar problems.

This blog will continue to have its layout updated, as I am practicing UI/UX and front end in general. Currently, this website is using [nue](https://github.com/nuejs/nue), but I might switch to either [astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro) or [React](https://react.dev) instead because they are much more consistent than nue.

I am also a _very_ active player in Gacha games. My favorites are Honkai: Star Rail and Fate/Grand Order. Do message me on Discord if you have inquiries.

```cpp
#include <print>

int main()
{
    std::println("Hello, World!");
}
```
